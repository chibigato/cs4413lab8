					<br/>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This gorgeous soap will lather a dark grey or black. like the clouds rolling in of a big storm. The scent will remind you of lightning hitting nearby, and the rain falling. However, like any storm, it will rinse off the black lather cleanly, and leave your hands smelling nice and feeling refreshed. We've had one customer say it helps with his callouses from his heavy duty job, and leaves his hands feeling nice and smooth. It's a popular and good scent for men and women.</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Today's special price is: $3.00 plus shipping and handling.<br/> <br/>
